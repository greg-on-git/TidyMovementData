# TidyMovementData
Tidy Data derived from UCI HAR Dataset

## Project Summary
This script and data set fulfill the final project of the Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera.  The goal is to take movement data generated by a smartphone while people are performing different activities, and clean up the data so it is easier to understand.  

## Using the Script
The script runs on data pulled from the following link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

To run this script, you will need to first download the zip file and unzip it.  Next, change your working directory in R to the directory that contains the files and folders from the zip file.  Then you will be ready to proceed with tidying the data using this script.

## Output
